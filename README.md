# Thephonebookbackend

Working branch for the part3 exercises of FullStackOpen course for cohort 2020 by etki_JS

This branch was created as an orphan branch to specifically accomodate the requirements for part3

For this fullstack application, the frontend build was served statically from the backend and the application was hosted on heroku. MongoDB Atlas is the database service used for the application.
